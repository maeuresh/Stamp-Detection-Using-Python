# Stamp-Detection-Using-Python

This project implements stamp detection using image processing techniques in Python. The goal of the project is to identify and highlight stamps in an image using a combination of preprocessing steps, such as Gaussian blurring, contour detection, and other OpenCV techniques.

1) Gaussian Blurring: Used to reduce noise and smoothen the image.

2) Contour Detection: Helps in identifying the boundaries of the stamps.
